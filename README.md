Iaas vs Paas vs SaaS
Iaas give more control over the infrastructure, the administrator will be responsable for more settings and future maintenance
PaaS the administrator give to provider the responsability from the OS, but still has some control over the application for personalization
Saas usually sold as subscription, only the app will be available for the administrator, often need to setup only users and groups

For each type provider has a a shared reponsability model, where impact the SLA and support responsability, for IaaS only the hardware and infrastructure is covered from provider, PaaS add the OS and SaaS will cover the most.
